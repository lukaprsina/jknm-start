description: Understand how to use Feature Kits for rapid editor setup with pre-configured plugins and UI components.

Feature Kits bundle related plugins and their UI components. They provide the fastest way to add editor features.

## What are Feature Kits?

Feature Kits are pre-assembled packages. They include multiple plugins and components for specific editor features.

For example, `BasicBlocksKit` includes plugins for paragraphs, headings, blockquotes, and horizontal rules. It also includes their UI components.

## Benefits of Using Kits

- **Fast setup**: Add multiple features with one import
- **Best practices**: Kits use sensible defaults and configurations
- **UI included**: Most kits include [Plate UI](/docs/installation/plate-ui) components
- **Simple dependencies**: Kits handle plugin dependencies automatically

## Kit Usage vs Manual Usage

Plugin documentation shows two approaches:

- **Kit Usage**: Use a pre-configured kit. This is the recommended approach for most users.
- **Manual Usage**: Install and configure each plugin individually. Use this when you need:
  - Custom plugin options beyond kit defaults
  - Different UI components or no UI (headless)
  - Only specific plugins from a kit

Kits are mostly the same as manual setup, but pre-configured.

## Finding Available Kits

Look for "Kit Usage" sections in plugin documentation. These sections show which kit to use and include the kit's source code.

## Example: BasicBlocksKit

The [`BasicBlocksKit`](/docs/basic-blocks#installation) includes these plugins and components:

- `ParagraphPlugin` with `ParagraphElement`
- `H1Plugin` with `H1Element`
- `H2Plugin` with `H2Element`
- `H3Plugin` with `H3Element`
- `BlockquotePlugin` with `BlockquoteElement`
- `HorizontalRulePlugin` with `HrElement`

Instead of adding each plugin separately, use the kit:

```tsx
import { createPlateEditor } from 'platejs/react';
import { BasicBlocksKit } from '@/components/editor/plugins/basic-blocks-kit';

const editor = createPlateEditor({
  plugins: [
    // ...otherPlugins,
    ...BasicBlocksKit,
  ],
});
```

This adds all block elements with their UI components.

## When to Use Manual Setup

Use manual setup when you need:

- **Custom options**: Kit defaults don't meet your needs
- **Custom UI**: You're not using [Plate UI](/docs/installation/plate-ui) components
- **Minimal setup**: You only need one or two plugins from a kit
- **Learning**: You want to understand how plugins work together
